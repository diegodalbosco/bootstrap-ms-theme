#Bootstrap Microsoft Theme
<img src="bootstrap-ms-theme.jpg" alt="Bootstrap Microsoft Theme"/>
I am trying to put microsoft.com website style into a bootstrap theme.
There are still many things to do (almost all :D)
##Todo and to review
- Change dropdown caret
- Check if default navbar style matches with ms style
- all the rest ...
